# Project Description

## Link to Deployed App
[https://nyu-marketplace-j4pxs.ondigitalocean.app/](https://nyu-marketplace-j4pxs.ondigitalocean.app/) -- No Longer Available

We containerized our app.

## Product Vision Statement
- Our team is looking to provide a secure place for NYU students to buy and sell items exclusively to and from one another.
Our product aims to allow students to get rid of items they no longer need as well as buy discounted used items from one another , with a focus on items needed in daily college life. Such items include but are not limited to textbooks, electronics, furniture, and other school supplies. Our project cuts out the risk factor inherent to other online marketplaces by connecting members of the NYU community to one another, and gives students the oppurtunity to buy and sell costly yet niche items, such as textbooks.

### Minimum Viable Product
- Our minimum viable product should grant users the follow features:
    - The ability to browse existing listings on the site
    - The ability to create a profile on the site to engage with listings
    - The ability to post listings to your account when signed in
    - The ability to contact the owners of listings to inquire about purchasing said listing

- Our team aims to fulfill the sites minimum functionality , and then look to both add new features and improve upon existing ones pending both our ongoing product vision, and early user feedback.

# Project History
- This project was proposed to remedy the issues common to other online marketplaces such as Ebay and Facebook Marketplaces. Most other online marketplaces have significant risks due to lack of vetting of sellers, which we seek to fix by limiting the user base to a closer knit group of people; NYU students. While the current scope of the project seeks to work within the NYU community, the project could be updated to include other NYC schools in the future. Guidelines for contributing to the project can be found in the [Contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md).
